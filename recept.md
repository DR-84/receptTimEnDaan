###DIRECTIONS
####Preheat the oven to 200°C/400°F/Gas Mark 6.
####Brush both sides of each tortilla with a light layer of vegetable oil and cut into 8 wedges (or other shapes as desired). Place the tortilla pieces in a single layer on a baking tray (you may need two trays), sprinkle with salt and bake in the preheated oven until lightly browned, about 8-10 minutes.
####In the meantime, start making the refried beans. Drain the black beans and rinse thoroughly. Peel and finely chop the garlic. Finely chop the coriander leaves. Put the oil into the frying pan on a high hear, add the garlic and fry until it starts to turn golden, then add the beans, cumin, coriander, Tamara and lime juice. Using the back of a wooden spoon, start mashing the beans, while continuing to fry for 2 minutes, adding a little water to prevent the beans from sticking to the pan. Add half the chopped fresh coriander leaves, mix through and remove from the heat.

####Once the tortillas have browned, remove from the oven and eat. drink beer!
